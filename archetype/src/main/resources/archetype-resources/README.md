This has been generated by the StormCrawler Maven Archetype as a starting point for building your own crawler.
Have a look at the code and resources and modify them to your heart's content. 

``` sh
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=${package}.CrawlTopology -Dexec.args="-conf crawler-conf.yaml -local"
```
to run the demo CrawlTopology in local mode.

Alternatively, generate an uberjar:
``` sh
mvn clean package
```
and then submit the topology with `storm jar`:

``` sh
storm jar target/${artifactId}-${version}.jar ${package}.CrawlTopology -conf crawler-conf.yaml -local
```

to run in local mode or 


``` sh
storm jar target/${artifactId}-${version}.jar ${package}.CrawlTopology -conf crawler-conf.yaml
```

to run it in distributed mode.

You can also use Flux to do the same:

``` sh
storm jar target/${artifactId}-${version}.jar  org.apache.storm.flux.Flux --local crawler.flux
```
