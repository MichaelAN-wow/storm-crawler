===========================

Elasticsearch has changed its licence to `Elastic License 2.0` in recent releases, which is not an ASFv2 compliant licence.
Therefore, the corresponding module was removed. Users can migrate to the `opensearch` module and follow the
[opensearch upgrade guideline](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/upgrade-to/upgrade-to/) to migrate existing elasticsearch installations.
